## üéÆ Game Overview

Rolly Fox is a 2D side-scrolling game where players control Rolly, a lively Rollins College fox mascot who can fly. The player guides Rolly as he glides through the air and avoids obstacles placed throughout a colorful version of the Rollins campus. Each obstacle successfully passed adds one point to the score, with the goal of staying airborne as long as possible while avoiding collisions.

**Target Users:** Casual players, Rollins College community (students, staff, and alumni), and younger players (ages 9-15) who enjoy quick and challenging reflex-based games.

**Genre:** 2D Side-Scrolling / Casual Arcade

### üí° Background & Motivation

The idea for Rolly Fox came from the desire to recreate the excitement of simple yet challenging games that require timing, focus, and persistence. The team wanted to combine that classic gameplay experience with a personal connection to Rollins College. The flying fox represents energy, curiosity, and determination‚Äîqualities that reflect the Rollins spirit. This project provides an opportunity to learn the fundamentals of 2D game development, including physics, object interaction, animation, and user interface design, while creating something fun and recognizable to the Rollins community.
